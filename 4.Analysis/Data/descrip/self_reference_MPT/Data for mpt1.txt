Data for SRET

Each row represents one participant.

Source memory test:
the first is item，second is responses
SG_SG:   Response "self" to a self item
SG_NSG:  Response "friend" to a self item
SG_Nw:   Response "new" to a self item
NSG_SG:  Response "self" to a friend item
NSG_NSG: Response "friend" to a friend item
NSG_Nw:  Response "new" to a friend item
Nw_SG:   Response "self" to a new item
Nw_NSG:  Response "friend" to a new item
Nw_Nw:   Response "new" to a new item


All external variables were standardised for analysis. 
Four chains with different starting values were run in parallel,using 500,000 adaptation samples for each chain. 
Each chain ran 1,000,000 iterations, with a burn-in period of 500,000 iterations and a thinning rate of 100 (Schaper et al., 2019). 
The Gelman-Rubin statistic R̂ was used to evaluate the convergence of parameter estimation (Gelman & Rubin, 1992). 

A value of R̂ smaller than 1.05 indicates good convergence. 

Test statistics T1 and T2 and their posterior predictive p values (PPP) reported the model’s goodness of fit (Klauer, 2010). 

T1 indicates the difference between the observed and posterior-predicted mean frequencies using Pearson’s χ2, and T2 indicates a similar difference in covariances. 

Larger PPP values indicate a satisfactory model fit (e.g. PPP > .05). 

The 95% Bayesian Credibility Interval (BCI), which indicates the interval in which the true parameter can be found with 95% probability, was reported for the estimation of the MPT parameters and their correlations with external variables. 

A correlation is deemed reliable if the 95% BCI of the corresponding standardised regression slope excludes zero.
